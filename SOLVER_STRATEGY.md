# SOLVER STRATEGY - Eagle West Field MRST Simulation

## üéØ Branch-Based Solver Organization

This repository uses a **branch-based approach** for different MRST solver implementations, allowing parallel development and easy comparison of simulation results.

## üåø Branch Structure

### `main` - Production Baseline
- **Current Status**: Latest stable implementation
- **Default Branch**: Primary development and integration
- **Merging**: All tested solver implementations merge back to main

### `incompTPFA` - Incompressible Two-Point Flux Solver
- **Solver Type**: `incompTPFA` (MRST incompressible pressure solver)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **WORKING** - Validated implementation
- **Production Rate**: 20,630 bbl/day
- **Recovery Factor**: 1.2% (limited by incompressible assumptions)
- **Use Case**: Pressure-driven flow, single-phase oil, no gas/compressibility
- **Limitations**: 
  - No gas liberation
  - No oil compressibility effects
  - Unrealistic recovery factors for real reservoirs
  - Steady-state pressure assumptions

### `ad-blackoil` - Automatic Differentiation Black-Oil Solver
- **Solver Type**: `ad-blackoil` (MRST compressible multi-phase solver)
- **Status**: üöß **PLANNED** - Not implemented yet
- **Target Features**:
  - Gas liberation and dissolution (Rs, Bo curves)
  - Oil and gas compressibility
  - Realistic PVT behavior with bubble point pressure
  - Time-dependent pressure depletion
  - Realistic recovery factors (15-25% for primary recovery)
- **Expected Performance**: More realistic production decline and recovery
- **Migration Priority**: HIGH - Next major implementation phase

### `experimental` - Testing Ground
- **Purpose**: Testing other MRST solvers and experimental configurations
- **Status**: üß™ **SANDBOX** - For exploration
- **Potential Solvers**:
  - `eosAD` - Compositional equation of state
  - `fully-implicit` - Advanced fully-implicit solvers
  - `geothermal` - Thermal recovery methods
  - Custom solvers and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods
- **Use Case**: Research, validation, and proof-of-concept implementations

## üîÑ Solver Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Current State (incompTPFA) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
```
YAML Config ‚Üí MATLAB Processing ‚Üí incompTPFA ‚Üí Basic Results
```
- **Completed**: Working simulation with 25 scripts
- **Data**: 9 modular .mat files with validated results
- **Performance**: 20,630 bbl/day production rate
- **Limitation**: Unrealistic 1.2% recovery due to incompressible flow

### Phase 2: Compressible Implementation (ad-blackoil) üéØ NEXT
```
YAML Config ‚Üí MATLAB Processing ‚Üí ad-blackoil ‚Üí Realistic Results
```
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. PVT table processing (bubble point, gas-oil ratio)
  2. Compressible fluid properties (Bo, Rs, Œºo curves)
  3. ad-blackoil solver integration
  4. Time-stepping and pressure depletion
  5. Validation against field analogues
- **Expected Outcome**: 15-25% recovery factor with realistic decline curves
- **Timeline**: Priority implementation after incompTPFA validation

### Phase 3: Advanced Solvers (experimental) üî¨ FUTURE
```

- **Research Areas**:
  - Compositional modeling for volatile oils
  - Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods
  - Thermal recovery processes
  - Fractured reservoir modeling
- **Timeline**: After ad-blackoil completion and production needs assessment

## üìä Performance Comparison Framework

### Current Results (incompTPFA)
| Metric | Value | Realistic? |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Production Rate** | 20,630 bbl/day | ‚úÖ Reasonable for 15 wells |
| **Initial Oil Saturation** | 71.1% | ‚úÖ Typical for oil reservoir |
| **Recovery Factor** | 1.2% | ‚ùå Unrealistically low |
| **Pressure Decline** | Minimal | ‚ùå Should show depletion |
| **Gas Production** | None | ‚ùå Should have solution gas |

### Expected Results (ad-blackoil)
| Metric | Expected Value | Basis |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Production Rate** | 18,000-22,000 bbl/day | Compressible decline |
| **Initial Oil Saturation** | 71.1% | Same as incompTPFA |
| **Recovery Factor** | 15-25% | Industry standard primary recovery |
| **Pressure Decline** | 500-1000 psi/year | Realistic depletion |
| **Gas Production** | 2000-4000 scf/stb | Solution gas drive |

## üîß Implementation Guidelines

### Switching Between Solvers

**Check current branch:**
```bash
git branch
```

**Switch to specific solver:**
```bash
# Switch to incompressible solver
git checkout incompTPFA

# Switch to compressible solver (when available)
git checkout ad-blackoil

# Switch to experimental testing
git checkout experimental
```

**Compare solver results:**
```bash
# Compare branches
git diff incompTPFA ad-blackoil

# Compare specific files
git diff incompTPFA:data/mrst/results.mat ad-blackoil:data/mrst/results.mat
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create feature branch** from appropriate solver branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout ad-blackoil
   git branch feature/pvt-table-integration
   git checkout feature/pvt-table-integration
   ```

2. **Implement changes** following Canon-First Policy:
   - Update YAML configurations first
   - Implement MATLAB processing logic
   - Integrate with MRST solver
   - Validate results against documentation

3. **Test and validate**:
   ```bash
   octave mrst_simulation_scripts/s99_run_workflow.m
   ```

4. **Merge back to solver branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout ad-blackoil
   git merge feature/pvt-table-integration
   ```

5. **Integrate to main** when stable:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge ad-blackoil
   ```
