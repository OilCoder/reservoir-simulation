Configuration Loading Cleanup Summary
=====================================
Date: January 30, 2025

PROBLEM:
Multiple redundant "Successfully loaded configuration from: config/*.yaml" messages 
were cluttering the workflow output, with some configuration files being read multiple 
times per script (e.g., fault_config.yaml appeared 5 times).

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Updated read_yaml_config.m utility functions to use silent mode by default
2. Fixed scripts with multiple reads of the same config file to cache and reuse
3. Added silent mode to all single config reads to reduce clutter
4. Maintained important status information while reducing visual noise

FILES MODIFIED:
============

1. read_yaml_config.m
   - Updated utility functions (load_grid_config, load_rock_config, etc.) to use silent mode
   
2. s07_define_rock_types.m
   - Fixed 3 reads of rock_properties_config.yaml → 1 read with caching
   - Added full_config to rock_params to avoid re-reading
   - Updated function signatures to pass cached config

3. s05_add_faults.m  
   - Fixed 2 reads of fault_config.yaml → 1 read with parameter passing
   - Updated add_fault_properties() to accept cached config

4. s03_define_fluids.m
   - Removed unused load_fluid_config() function
   - Kept single read in create_default_fluid_params()

5. Scripts updated to use silent mode:
   - s02_create_grid.m (grid_config.yaml)
   - s04_structural_framework.m (structural_framework_config.yaml)
   - s06_grid_refinement.m (grid_config.yaml)
   - s09_spatial_heterogeneity.m (rock_properties_config.yaml)
   - s10_relative_permeability.m (both scal_properties_config.yaml and fluid_properties_config.yaml)
   - s11_capillary_pressure.m (scal_properties_config.yaml)
   - s13_pressure_initialization.m (initialization_config.yaml)
   - s14_saturation_distribution.m (initialization_config.yaml, scal_properties_config.yaml)
   - s15_aquifer_configuration.m (initialization_config.yaml)

6. s12_pvt_tables.m
   - Already using silent mode correctly (no changes needed)

RESULT:
- Reduced configuration loading messages from ~15+ per workflow to ~8
- Eliminated redundant file reads (performance improvement)
- Maintained policy compliance (no hardcoding)
- Kept important status information while reducing visual clutter
- Each config file now shows loading message only once per script

BEFORE: 
Successfully loaded configuration from: config/fault_config.yaml
Successfully loaded configuration from: config/fault_config.yaml  
Successfully loaded configuration from: config/fault_config.yaml
Successfully loaded configuration from: config/fault_config.yaml
Successfully loaded configuration from: config/fault_config.yaml
(+ many more for other configs)

AFTER:
✅ Configurations loaded successfully
(Clean, concise status messages where appropriate)
