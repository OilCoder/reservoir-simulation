# Phase 7 Implementation Summary - MRST Workflow

## Implementation Completed: August 8, 2025

### Scripts Created

#### **s19_development_schedule.m** - Development Schedule Implementation
- **Purpose**: 6-Phase Development Program over 10 years (3,650 days)
- **Key Features**:
  - Phase 1 (Day 1-365): 1 producer (EW-001)
  - Phase 2 (Day 366-730): 2 producers + 1 injector  
  - Phase 3 (Day 731-1095): 4 producers + 2 injectors
  - Phase 4 (Day 1096-1825): 7 producers + 3 injectors
  - Phase 5 (Day 1826-2920): 9 producers + 4 injectors
  - Phase 6 (Day 2921-3650): 10 producers + 5 injectors
  - Well startup schedules with drilling dates
  - MRST schedule structure for simulation
  - Timeline milestones and decision points

**Outputs**:
- `development_schedule.mat` - Complete schedule data structure
- `development_schedule_summary.txt` - Human-readable summary
- `development_milestones.txt` - Timeline milestones
- `mrst_simulation_schedule.mat` - MRST-ready schedule structure

---

#### **s20_production_targets.m** - Production Targets and Optimization
- **Purpose**: Production optimization with economic analysis
- **Key Features**:
  - Peak production: 18,500 STB/day (Phase 6)
  - Voidage replacement ratios: 0.95-1.20 per phase
  - Field pressure maintenance strategy (>2,400 psi target)
  - Production targets per well and phase
  - Rate constraints and optimization
  - Economic optimization logic with NPV analysis

**Outputs**:
- `production_targets.mat` - Complete targets data structure
- `production_targets_summary.txt` - Production targets summary
- `well_allocation_targets.txt` - Well-level allocation targets
- `economic_optimization.txt` - Economic analysis results

### Integration with Existing Workflow

Both scripts integrate seamlessly with the existing MRST workflow:

1. **Data Dependencies**:
   - Load from `s18_production_controls.m` outputs
   - Use `wells_config.yaml` for canonical data
   - Build on well placement and completion data

2. **MRST Compatibility**:
   - Generate MRST-compatible schedule structures
   - Follow established step/substep patterns
   - Use Google Style docstrings
   - Include comprehensive error handling

3. **Economic Optimization**:
   - Oil price: $70/bbl baseline
   - Gas price: $4.50/MCF
   - Water handling and injection costs included
   - ESP operating costs factored
   - NPV-based optimization logic

### Canonical Data Implementation

Both scripts strictly follow the canonical documentation:

- **05_Wells_Completions.md**: Well specifications, drilling dates, completion details
- **06_Production_History.md**: Production targets, VRR ratios, phase timelines
- All 15 wells (10 producers + 5 injectors) properly scheduled
- Phase-based development strategy with realistic timelines

### Phase 7 Deliverables Status: âœ… COMPLETE

The development schedule and production targets are now fully implemented and ready for Phase 8 (simulation execution). Both scripts prepare all necessary data structures for MRST simulation runs with:

- Complete 6-phase development program
- Well-level production allocation
- Pressure maintenance strategy
- Economic optimization framework
- Timeline milestone tracking

**Next Phase**: Phase 8 - Simulation Execution and Results Analysis
