=== S12 INITIAL_GOR ERROR: DEBUGGER ANALYSIS RESULTS ===
Date: 2025-08-08
Status: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - READY FOR CODER FIX

ERROR DETAILS:
- Error Message: "structure has no member 'initial_gor'"
- Location: s12_pvt_tables.m line 762
- Function: export_comprehensive_pvt_summary
- Context: Export/summary generation phase (Step 4)

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
✓ YAML Configuration: Contains 'solution_gor' field with value 450 scf/STB
✓ Line 537 Assignment: oil_props.initial_gor = pvt_config.solution_gor; works correctly  
✓ Structure Creation: fluid.oil_properties = oil_props; works correctly
✗ Line 762 Access: Missing defensive field validation in export function

EXACT PROBLEM:
Line 762: fprintf(fid, '  Initial GOR: %.0f scf/STB\n', fluid.oil_properties.initial_gor);
This line lacks defensive validation, unlike api_gravity (lines 757-761).

EXACT SOLUTION NEEDED:
Replace line 762 with defensive validation pattern:

CURRENT (BROKEN):
    fprintf(fid, '  Initial GOR: %.0f scf/STB\n', fluid.oil_properties.initial_gor);

FIXED (DEFENSIVE):
    if isfield(fluid.oil_properties, 'initial_gor')
        fprintf(fid, '  Initial GOR: %.0f scf/STB\n', fluid.oil_properties.initial_gor);
    else
        fprintf(fid, '  Initial GOR: Not available\n');
    end

COMPARISON WITH WORKING PATTERN:
The api_gravity field already uses this defensive pattern (lines 757-761):
    if isfield(fluid.oil_properties, 'api_gravity')
        fprintf(fid, '  API Gravity: %.1f°\n', fluid.oil_properties.api_gravity);
    else
        fprintf(fid, '  API Gravity: Not available\n');
    end

INVESTIGATION CONFIDENCE: VERY HIGH
- Same error pattern as the api_gravity issue that was already fixed
- Identical defensive validation solution needed
- YAML configuration is correct
- Assignment logic is correct
- Only the export function lacks validation

ACTION FOR CODER:
1. Apply defensive validation pattern to line 762 in s12_pvt_tables.m
2. Use exact same pattern as api_gravity (lines 757-761)
3. Test the fix by running s12_pvt_tables.m
