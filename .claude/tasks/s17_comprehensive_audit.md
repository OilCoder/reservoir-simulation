# S17 Production Controls Comprehensive Audit Task

## Mission
Execute comprehensive audit of s17_production_controls.m using proven 5-phase methodology that transformed s16 from Grade D- to Grade A+.

## Target File
`/workspace/mrst_simulation_scripts/s17_production_controls.m`

## 5-Phase Methodology

### PHASE 1: Policy Compliance Analysis
- Read complete s17_production_controls.m
- Verify compliance with 6 policies in `.claude/policies/`:
  * Canon-First Policy
  * Data Authority Policy  
  * Fail Fast Policy
  * Exception Handling Policy
  * KISS Principle Policy
  * No Over-Engineering Policy
- Identify specific violations with line numbers
- Assign grade: A+ (95-100), A (90-94), B+ (85-89), B (80-84), B- (75-79), C+ (70-74), C (65-69), C- (60-64), D+ (55-59), D (50-54), D- (0-49)

### PHASE 2: Independent Execution Test
- Execute s17_production_controls.m independently using Octave
- Capture ALL output including warnings and errors
- Analyze session management and MRST integration
- Verify execution-blocking bugs
- Test warning suppression effectiveness
- Verify integration with s16 output (wells.mat)

### PHASE 3: Data Structure Validation
- Verify s17 generates data per `docs/Planning/Simulation_Data_Catalog/00_Data_Catalog_Overview.md`
- Validate Development Plan Chain: s17 (Production Controls) → schedule.mat
- Confirm canonical data structure in `/workspace/data/mrst/`
- Verify data size and content expectations
- Confirm integration with s16 wells.mat output (8.9 MB)

### PHASE 4: Technical Correctness Evaluation
- Analyze production controls logic for 15-well system
- Verify YAML configuration integration
- Confirm well control assignments and pressure limits
- Evaluate MRST compatibility and structure compliance
- Review Eagle West Field specifications compliance

### PHASE 5: Bug Detection and Code Quality
- Identify syntax, logic, runtime errors
- Verify hardcoded values vs config-driven approach
- Analyze session management patterns
- Verify path handling and file operations
- Review error handling and validation

## Critical Focus Areas
- Modern MRST session management (s16 A+ pattern)
- Complete YAML configuration integration
- Canonical data structure (/workspace/data/mrst/)
- Production controls for 15-well system
- BHP limits and rate assignment strategies
- Warning suppression after MRST setup

## Validation Specifications
- Eagle West Field: 15 wells (EW-001 to EW-010, IW-001 to IW-005)
- Field production target: 18,500 STB/day
- BHP pressure controls for producers and injectors
- Integration with s16 wells.mat (8.9 MB)
- Development Plan Chain contribution → schedule.mat

## Required Output
1. **Detailed Grade**: Letter with numeric score (0-100)
2. **Policy Violations**: Specific violations with line numbers
3. **Execution Results**: Complete output with errors/warnings
4. **Data Validation**: Whether s17 properly contributes to schedule.mat
5. **Bug List**: All identified bugs with severity (Critical/Major/Minor)
6. **Fix Recommendations**: Prioritized list of required fixes

## Success Expectation
Based on previous audit, s17 showed Grade A+ (95/100) with exceptional implementation. Confirm this quality level and identify improvement opportunities to maintain production standards.

## Technical Context
- s16 already achieved Grade A+ (100/100) with perfect execution
- wells.mat updated to 8.9 MB with complete completion data
- s17 must integrate with s16 output to initiate Development Plan Chain
- System must follow exact Eagle West Field specifications
