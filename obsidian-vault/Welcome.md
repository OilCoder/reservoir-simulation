# Welcome to Your Obsidian Vault

This is your documentation vault for the project. You can use this space to:

- Document your project architecture
- Keep meeting notes
- Track decisions and changes
- Create knowledge bases
- Link related concepts together

## Getting Started

- Create new notes by typing `[[Note Name]]` and clicking the link
- Use `#tags` to organize your content
- Link related notes together with `[[wikilinks]]`

## Sample Structure

You might want to organize your vault like this:

- **Projects/** - Project-specific documentation
- **Daily Notes/** - Daily meeting notes and updates  
- **Knowledge Base/** - Reference materials and guides
- **Templates/** - Note templates for consistency

Happy documenting!
