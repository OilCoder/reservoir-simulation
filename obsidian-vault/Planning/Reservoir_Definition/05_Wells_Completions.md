# Wells and Completions - Eagle West Field

## Executive Summary

The Eagle West Field development incorporates seven wells consisting of four producers (PROD1-PROD4) and three injectors (INJ1-INJ3) strategically positioned to optimize recovery from the three-sand reservoir system. The completion design emphasizes selective perforation strategies across Upper, Middle, and Lower Sand intervals with comprehensive artificial lift systems for sustained production.
