============================

Export Date: 2025-08-21 17:09:00
Source: MRST Workflow (Eagle West Field)
Target: OPM Flow Simulator

FILES CREATED:
- EAGLE_WEST.DATA (Master simulation deck)
- GRID.inc (Grid geometry and properties)
- PROPS.inc (Rock properties)
- PVT.inc (Fluid properties and relative permeability)
- WELLS.inc (Well specifications and completions)
- SCHEDULE.inc (Production schedule and controls)
- SOLUTION.inc (Initial conditions)

NEXT STEPS:
1. Run OPM Flow simulation: flow EAGLE_WEST.DATA
2. Analyze results with OPM utilities
3. Import results back to MRST if needed
