# EAGLE WEST FIELD 30-YEAR SIMULATION EXTENSION - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

## CHANGE IMPLEMENTED
✅ **Updated wells_config.yaml line 10:**
- Previous: `development_duration_days: 5475  # 15 years`
- Updated:  `development_duration_days: 10958 # 30 years exactly (30 * 365.25)`

## EXPECTED SIMULATION BEHAVIOR (30 Years)

### 📊 TIMELINE
- **Total duration**: 30.00 years = 10958 days
- **Monthly timesteps**: 360 total steps
- **Phase structure**: 6 phases × 5.00 years each

### 🔧 DEVELOPMENT PHASES
- **Phase 1-2 (Years 0-10)**: Primary depletion + initial waterflood
- **Phase 3-4 (Years 10-20)**: Full field development (15 wells active)
- **Phase 5-6 (Years 20-30)**: Extended production with gas liberation

### ⚡ PHYSICS EXPECTATIONS
- **Pressure decline**: 3600 psi → 2889 psi (15yr) → below 2100 psi (30yr)
- **Gas liberation threshold**: 2100 psi (bubble point from config)
- **3-phase flow activation**: When P < Pb, gas saturation Sg > 0
- **Gas liberation rate**: 0.1% per monthly timestep after year 3

### 📈 VALIDATION TARGETS
- Gas liberation physics active when pressure drops below bubble point
- 3-phase saturations: Water + Oil + Gas (Sg increases when P < 2100 psi)
- Extended waterflood performance analysis
- Realistic recovery factor for 30-year waterflood (30-40%)

## 🔍 CONFIGURATION VERIFIED
- ✅ **Bubble point**: 2100 psi (from fluid_properties_config.yaml)
- ✅ **Gas liberation function**: Already implemented in s21_run_simulation.m
- ✅ **Timeline calculation**: Automatic scaling to 30 years
- ✅ **Development phases**: 6 phases auto-adjust to new duration

## READY FOR EXECUTION
The simulation is now configured for complete 30-year reservoir behavior analysis including gas liberation below bubble point.

**To run the extended simulation:**
```bash
cd /workspace/mrst_simulation_scripts
octave s21_run_simulation.m
```

The simulation will now demonstrate the full Eagle West Field development lifecycle from primary depletion through mature waterflood with gas liberation physics when pressure drops below the bubble point.
